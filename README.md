# Pat's Tech Blog

## Description

  - This is a full-stack blog application built with express, handlebars, sequelize, mysql2 and uses the MVC paradigm.
  - I wanted to build a full stack web application to demonstrate all of the skills I have learned so far.
  - This application provides a tech blog so techie types can write about the technologies they use or want to use and others can comment on their posts.
  - This application makes it easy to collaboarate with other technical users about technology.
  - I leanred a lot during this project. I learned how to encrypt passwords with bcrypt, ORM and session management with sequelize and express-session, and I learned about MVC and templates with handlebars.
